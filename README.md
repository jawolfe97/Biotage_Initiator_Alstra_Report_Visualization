# PDF to TXT Extractor

This repository contains a Python script that automatically extracts text from all PDF files in the same folder as the script. For each PDF, the script creates a `.txt` file with the same base name, including page numbers and extracted text content.

## Features

- Iterates through all PDF files in the script's directory  
- Extracts text from every page  
- Writes output into `.txt` files with the same name as the original PDF  
- Each page in the `.txt` file includes:
Page N
<text from page>

markdown
Copy code
- Supports multi-page PDFs  
- Works with both newer and older versions of **PyPDF2**

## Requirements

- Python **3.8+**  
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)  

Install PyPDF2 with:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2
```
## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Place the script in the same folder as your PDFs.

3. Run the script:
```
python pdf_to_txt.py
```

4. The script will create a ```.txt``` file for each ```.pdf``` file in the same folder.

Example:
```

```

## Notes

If a PDF contains only scanned images, no text will be extracted (OCR is not included).
